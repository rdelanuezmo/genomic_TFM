3055;5739187;28703942;10/11/2018 10:44;This study found DGTT3 to have a significant response to low temperatures, phosphorus deficiency, and other stresses, such as high concentrations of NaCl, 20 muM GA, and 20 muM abscisic acid. Deletion and scanning mutagenesis analyses revealed that the - 319/- 247 region is essential for low-temperature and phosphate-deficiency-mediated induction of DGTT3 expression.[DGTT3]
3055;5739187;28781053;21/07/2018 10:30;"This study identified POB15 and POC16 as two proteins of the central core region, the distribution of which correlates with that of tubulin glutamylation; POB15 is an inner barrel protein within this region. Two poc16 mutants exhibit flagellar defects, indicating that POC16 is important for flagellum biogenesis. Human WDR90 is required for ciliogenesis, echoing the findings in Chlamydomonas. [POB15]"

3055;5739187;28892495;14/10/2017 11:08;the role of PF23/DYX1C1 remains unknown, but we suggest that DYX1C1 could provide a scaffold for macromolecular assembly
3055;5739187;29167384;12/01/2019 12:00;The C-terminal region of DRC2 is critical for the coassembly of DRC2 and DRC1 to form the base plate of N-DRC and its attachment to the outer doublet microtubule. Loss of DRC2 disrupts the assembly of several other N-DRC subunits and destabilizes the assembly of several closely associated structures such as the inner dynein arms, the radial spokes, and the calmodulin- and spoke-associated complex.
